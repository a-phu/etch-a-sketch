# etch-a-sketch
Second project using HTML/CSS/Javascript from The Odin Project curriculum.

It is a simple "etch-a-sketch" game where users can:
* draw by dragging their mouse over the cells within the grid
* choose different colours by clicking the circle and picking a colour
* toggling between "colour mode" and "rainbow mode" where user can either pick a colour or use a randomly generated colour pen
* erase what they have drawn
* clear their sketch
* change the number of squares inside the grid by dragging the slider across

Live version is [here](https://a-phu.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).
